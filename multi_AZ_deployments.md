# Multi-AZ deployments for high availability

Multi-AZ deployments can have one standby or two standby DB instances. When the deployment has one standby DB instance, it's called a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. A Multi-AZ DB instance deployment has one standby DB instance that provides failover support, but doesn't serve read traffic. 

When the deployment has two standby DB instances, it's called a Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment. A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment has standby DB instances that provide failover support and can also serve read traffic.

You can use the AWS Management Console to determine whether a Multi-AZ deployment is a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment or a Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment. In the navigation pane, choose Databases, and then choose a DB identifier.

## Multi-AZ DB instance deployments

Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments with a single standby DB instance. This type of deployment is called a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Amazon RDS uses several different technologies to provide this failover support. Multi-AZ deployments for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances use the Amazon failover technology. Microsoft SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs). For information on SQL Server version support for Multi-AZ, see Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server.

In a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy and minimize latency spikes during system backups. Running a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system maintenance. It can also help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption. For more information on Availability Zones, see Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones.

### Failover process for Amazon RDS

If a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance results from an infrastructure defect, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have turned on Multi-AZ. The time that it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds. However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time. When the failover is complete, it can take additional time for the RDS console to reflect the new Availability Zone.

## Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments

A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment is a high availability deployment mode of Amazon RDS with two readable standby DB instances. A Multi-AZ DB cluster has a writer DB instance and two reader DB instances in three separate Availability Zones in the same AWS Region. Multi-AZ DB clusters provide high availability, increased capacity for read workloads, and lower write latency when compared to Multi-AZ DB instance deployments.

### Overview of Multi-AZ DB clusters

With a Multi-AZ DB cluster, Amazon RDS replicates data from the writer DB instance to both of the reader DB instances using the DB engine's native replication capabilities. When a change is made on the writer DB instance, it's sent to each reader DB instance. Acknowledgment from at least one reader DB instance is required for a change to be committed.

Reader DB instances act as automatic failover targets and also serve read traffic to increase application read throughput. If an outage occurs on your writer DB instance, RDS manages failover to one of the reader DB instances. RDS does this based on which reader DB instance has the most recent change record.

# What is an Application Load Balancer?

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

## Application Load Balancer components

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.

A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. When the conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed. You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can optionally define additional rules.

Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify. You can register a target with multiple target groups. You can configure health checks on a per target group basis. Health checks are performed on all targets registered to a target group that is specified in a listener rule for your load balancer.
